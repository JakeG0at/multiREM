Dozens of H2S-sensitive genes were identified from comparison of cell transcriptome in different H2S concentrations. Mc sulfide quinone reductase (SQR) and persulfide dioxygenase were found to be active during sulfide detoxification. Moreover, xoxF, a novel lanthanide(Ln)-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) was overexpressed in H2S while mxaF, a calcium-dependent MDH, was down-regulated, and such MDH switch phenomenon is also well known to be induced by addition of lanthanide via an as-yet-unknown mechanism. Activities in quorum sensing and RND efflux pump also suggest their role in sulfide detoxification, and might provide insight on the xoxF/mxaF switch mechanism.

        "project_description": "Methanotrophs, which help regulate atmospheric levels of methane, are active in diverse natural and man-made environments. This range of habitats and the feast-famine cycles seen by many environmental methanotrophs suggest that methanotrophs dynamically mediate rates of methane oxidation. Global methane budgets require ways to account for this variability in time and space. Functional gene biomarker transcripts are increasingly being studied to inform the dynamics of diverse biogeochemical cycles. Previously, per-cell transcript levels of the methane oxidation biomarker, pmoA, were found to vary quantitatively with respect to methane oxidation rates in model aerobic methanotroph, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. In the present study, these trends were explored for two additional aerobic methanotroph pure cultures, Methylocystis parvus OBBP and Methylomicrobium album BG8. At steady-state conditions, per cell pmoA mRNA transcript levels strongly correlated with per cell methane oxidation across the three methanotrophs across many orders of magnitude of activity (R2 = 0.91). Additionally, genome-wide expression data (RNA-seq) were used to explore transcriptomic responses of steady state M. album BG8 cultures to short-term CH4 and O2 limitation. These limitations induced regulation of genes involved in central carbon metabolism (including carbon storage), cell motility, and stress response. Overall design: Comparison of genome-wide expression (RNA-seq) of M. album BG8 grown in bioreactors under steady-state, substrate replete conditions (reference) and corresponding periods of substrate (experimental condtion, methane and oxygen) limited conditions. Samples from substrate limited conditions are two hours after the onset of substrate limitation. Total of eight samples, duplicate for each condition which are from reactor replicates.",

The framework relies solely on whole genome and RNA sequencing data types, which are easily accessible to a variety of research groups. The framework proceeds in three main stages: 1) identification of a group of highly expressed loci that maintain high transcript counts across a broad range of experimental conditions, 2) extraction of the corresponding upstream candidate promoter regions of these highly expressed loci while minding nearby annotations and avoiding those that may potentially reside in operons, and 3) application of the motif finding algorithm in BioProspector to these upstream regions to predict the location and sequence of the -35 and -10 hexamers that drive the strong expression of these loci. Ultimately, we report sequences of 27-30 bases in length as candidate -35, -10 signals for each of the top loci and create a consensus motif from these predictions. We apply our framework to 80 RNA-seq datasets collected for the methanotroph Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense 5GB1 and validate our predictions computationally and experimentally. The data deposited here represent all RNA-seq data that, until this study, has not previously been published. Overall design: 80 RNA-seq datasets measuring Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense expression across 12 experimental growth conditions were compiled from a previously published data sets, additionally including their associated quality control runs, and several previously unpublished experiments. RNA-seq data were generated from a mix of Illumina protocols using a variety of read lengths (36, 50, and 150 bp) and paired and unpaired libraries. Of these 80 datasets, 24 have been previuosly published and deposited. The remaining 56 samples are deposited here.",

In this paper, we present a comprehensive metagenome dataset including shotgun metagenomes from around 30 stratified lakes and ponds mainly located in the boreal and subarctic regions, but also including one reservoir from tropical Puerto Rico and one Swiss lake from the temperate zone. For most lakes and ponds, the data includes a vertical sample set spanning the oxic surface waters to anoxic bottom layers. In addition to the metagenomic sequences, the dataset includes environmental variables for the samples, such as oxygen, nutrient and carbon concentrations. The dataset is ideal for further exploring the microbial taxonomic and functional diversity in freshwater environments and climate change impacts on the functioning of these ecosystems."

The physiological, transcriptional and metabolic responses of M. alcaliphilum to high NaCl concentrations, have been studied using RNA-seq, metabolic modeling and enzyme activity tests. M. alcaliphilum was revealed to have an unusual respiratory chain, in which complex I is replaced by a Na+ extruding NQR complex (highly upregulated under high salinity conditions) and a Na+ driven ATP synthase that coexists with a more usual H+ driven ATP synthase. A thermodynamic and metabolic model showing the interplay between these different components is presented. Ectoine is the main osmoprotector used by the cells (but its effect is not enough to avoid molecular crowding as a result of large water outflow and the expression of chaperones is necessary). Ectoine synthesis is activated by the transcription of an ect operon that contains 5 genes, including the ectoine hydroxylase coding ectD gene. Enzymatic tests revealed that the product of ectD does not have catalytic activity. A new Genome Scale Metabolic Model for M. alcalyphilum was reconstructed and used to integrate RNA-seq data and reveal a higher flux in the oxidative branch of the penthose phosphate pathway leading to NADPH production and contributing to resistance to oxidative stress.",

        "project_description": "Methylobacter species, members of the Methylococcales, have recently emerged as some of the globally widespread, cosmopolitan species, appearing to play a key role in consumption of methane in a variety of environments and across gradients of dioxygen tensions. We approached the question of how Methylobacter copes with low dioxygen partial pressures that it encounters in its natural habitats, via laboratory manipulation. Through comparative transcriptomics of cultures grown under high dioxygen partial pressure and cultures starved for dioxygen, we identified a gene cluster encoding a hybrid cluster protein along with sensing and regulatory functions. Through mutant analysis we demonstrated that this gene cluster is involved in both oxidative and nitrosative stress responses and in NO reduction, while being responsive to NO, likely through direct sensing. Through additional transcriptomic analyses, we further uncovered a complex interconnection between the NO-mediated stress response and quorum sensing in turn controlling synthesis of the secondary metabolite tundrenone, these two systems being inversely regulated. Some of the key methylotrophy functions, such as the two alternative methanol dehydrogenases seem to be parts of the stress response regulatory cascade. One intriguing scenario that emerged from our analyses is that the main role of the respiratory denitrification pathway may be in producing the signaling molecule, NO, in response to hypoxia, rather than in serving as an energy-generating pathway. This novel and complex hypoxia stress response system is unique to Methylobacter tundripaludum, and it may play a role in the environmental fitness of these organisms and in their cosmopolitan environmental distribution. Overall design: 10 samples from Methylobacter tundripaludum 31/32 and 6 from M. tundripaludum 21/22 were processed with biological duplicates across a variety of conditions. In 31/32 the wild-type sequence was grown with either nitrate or ammonia as the provided nitrogen sources (2 samples). Also in 31/32, the wild-type and a deletion mutant in hcp/hcr were grown with and without low dioxygen stress, and with either nitrate or ammonia as the added nitrogen source (8 samples). In 21/22, the wild type and two mutant strains (one in the quorum sensing systema and one in the production of tundrinone) and the wild type were each grown in nitrate or ammonia as the proviced nitrogen source (6 samples).",

Complete EMP, ED, PP and TCA pathway were proved to exist and express in ZR1. The ppi-dependent EMP enzyme and complete TCA cycle efficiently produce energy and reduce power for the growth of ZR1\uff0cwhich might be responsible for its fast growth. Lower TCA cycle activity might be responsible for the worse growth of ZR1 with methanol under 30\u2103. Several important metabolic pathways were found correlating with carbon sources. Metabolism of formaldehyde was proved to be a key nod that may be responsible for the carbon conversion efficiency in ZR1. The higher expression level of the formaldehyde assimilation genes in comparison with the catabolism genes might be responsible for the higher carbon conversion efficiency of ZR1 from methane than methanol. Meanwhile, the flexible nitrogen and carotene metabolism related with the carbon substrates were also investigated in ZR1. Nitrogenase genes in ZR1 were found to be highly expressed with methane as carbon sources even though enough nitrate existed in the medium.

These organisms provide a carbon and energy source for species that cannot oxidize methane themselves, thereby serving a key role in these niches while also sequestering this potent greenhouse gas before it enters the atmosphere. Deciphering the molecular details of how methane-oxidizing bacteria interact in the environment enables us to understand an important aspect that shapes the structure and function these communities. Here we show that many members of the Methylomonas genus possess a LuxR-type acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) receptor/transcription factor highly homologous to MbaR from the quorum sensing (QS) system of Methylobacter tundripaludum, another methane-oxidizer that has been isolated from the same environment. We reconstitute this detection system in Escherichia coli and also use mutant and transcriptomic analysis to show that the receptor from Methylomonas species strain LW13 (LW13) is active and alters LW13 gene expression in response to the acyl-HSL produced by M. tundripaludum. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for how two species of bacteria that may compete for resources in the environment can interact in a specific manner through a chemical signal. Overall design: In order to determine which genes MmsR regulates in response to acyl-HSL signal, we compared the transcriptome of exponentially growing LW13 in the presence or absence of 3-OH-C10-HSL. As a control for gene changes that are not the result of signal binding to MmsR, we constructed an unmarked, in-frame deletion of mmsR (\u2206mmsR) and also compared the transcriptome of this strain in the presence and absence of signal.

Salt-stress significantly inhibited methanotrophic activity at > 0.3 M NaCl; at 0.6 M NaCl amendment, methanotrophic activity fully ceased. MiSeq sequence and qPCR analyses revealed that type Ia methanotroph (Methylobacter) appeared to be favored under salinity up to 0.3 M NaCl, increasing in numerical abundance, while the type Ib subgroup was adversely affected. This suggests niche differentiation within members of the gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs. Overall, rice paddy soil methanotrophs showed remarkable resistance to salt-stress."

        "project_description": "Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1 is an obligate methylotroph, which grows on methane or methanol with similar growth rates. Core metabolic pathways are similar on both substrates, but recent studies of methane metabolism suggest that growth on methanol might have significant differences from growth on methane. In this study, both a targeted metabolomics approach as well as a 13C tracer approach have been taken to understand core carbon metabolism in M. buryatense 5GB1 during methanol growth, to determine whether such differences occur. Targeted metabolomics analyses were performed on both methane and methanol cultures to identify metabolic nodes with altered fluxes. Several key metabolites showed significant differences in pool size. Noticeably, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) showed much larger pools under methanol culture, suggesting the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway was more active. Intermediates in other parts of metabolism also showed differences in pool sizes under methanol growth. A systematic shift of active core metabolism is proposed to explain the changes. In order to distinguish flux partition differences at the C3-C4 node, 13C tracer analysis was also applied to methanol-grown cultures. Using the experimental results as constraints, we applied flux balance analysis to determine the metabolic flux phenotype of M. buryatense 5GB1 growing on methanol. The resulting new insights into core metabolism of this methanotroph provide an improved basis for future strain design. Overall design: RNA-seq analysis of gene expression of M. buryatense 5GB1 grown in continuous bioreactor culture.

One group of excreted compounds are short-chain organic acids, generated in highest abundance when cultures are grown under O2-starvation. We examined this O2-starvation condition in the methanotroph Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C\u00a0. Under prolonged O2-starvation in a closed vial, this methanotroph increases the amount of acetate excreted about 10-fold, but the formate, lactate, and succinate excreted do not respond to this culture condition. In bioreactor cultures, the amount of each excreted product is similar across a range of growth rates and limiting substrates, including O2-limitation. A set of mutants were generated in genes predicted to be involved in generating or regulating excretion of these compounds and tested for growth defects, and changes in excretion products. The phenotypes and associated metabolic flux modeling suggested that in M. buryatense 5GB1C, formate and acetate are excreted in response to redox imbalance, and the resulting metabolic state represents a combination of fermentation and respiration metabolism. \u00a0 Overall design: RNA-seq analysis of gene expression of M. buryatense 5GB1 grown in continuous bioreactor culture. Several conditions were used to isolate the effects of O2 limitation on 5GB1 metabolism: O2 limitation at slow growth, O2 limitation with fast growth, CH4 limitation with fast growth, and a terminal oxidase knockout mutant. Each condition had two biological replicates, and between 1 and 4 technical replicates.",

        "project_description": "Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria use methane as their sole source of carbon and energy and serve as a major sink for the potent greenhouse gas methane in freshwater ecosystems. Despite this important environmental role, little is known about the molecular details of how these organisms interact in the environment. Many bacterial species use quorum sensing systems to regulate gene expression in a density-dependent manner. We have identified a quorum sensing system in the genome of Methylobacter tundripaludum, a dominant methane-oxidizer in methane enrichments of sediment from Lake Washington (Seattle, WA, USA). We determined that M. tundripaludum primarily produces N-3-hydroxydecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3-OH-C\u00ad10-HSL) and that production is governed by a positive feedback loop. We then further characterized this system by determining which genes are regulated by quorum sensing in this methane-oxidizer using RNA-seq, and discovered this system regulates the expression of a novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster. These results identify and characterize a mode of cellular communication in an aerobic methane-oxidizing bacterium. Overall design: Samples are 2 sets of biological replicates of a Methylobacter tundripaludum strain 21/22 mutant where the acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) synthase gene mbaI (T451DRAFT_0796) has been deleted. The mutant strain was grown to log (48 hours) or stationary (68 hours) phase in the absence or presence of the AHL 3-OH-C10-HSL.",

The MxaFI methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) contains calcium in its active site, while the XoxF enzyme contains a lanthanide in its active site. The genes encoding the MDH enzymes are differentially regulated by the presence of lanthanides. In this study, we discover that the histidine kinase MxaY controls the lanthanide-mediated switch in Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C. MxaY controls the transcription of genes encoding MxaFI and XoxF at least partially by controlling the transcript levels of the orphan response regulator MxaB. We discover a constitutively active version of MxaY, and identify the mutated residue that may be involved in lanthanide sensing. Lastly, we find evidence to suggest that tight control of active MDH production is required for wild-type growth rates."

While regulatory functions have been demonstrated for a small number of bacteria, there have been no large-scale studies of prokaryotic methylomes and the full repertoire of targets and biological functions of DNA methylation remains unclear. Here we applied single-molecule, real-time sequencing to directly study the methylomes of 232 phylogenetically diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, we identified 834 methylated motifs, enabling the specific annotation of 415 DNA methyltransferases (MTases), and adding substantially to existing databases of MTase specificities. While the majority of MTases function as components of restriction-modification systems, 139 MTases have no cognate restriction enzyme in the genome, suggesting some other functional role. Several of these \u2018orphan\u2019 MTases are conserved across species and exhibit patterns of DNA methylation consistent with known regulatory MTases. Based on these patterns of methylation, we identify candidate novel regulators of gene expression in several phyla of bacteria, and candidate regulators of DNA replication in Haloarchaea. Together these data substantially advance our knowledge of DNA restriction-modification systems, and hint at a wider role for methylation in prokaryotic genome regulation.
